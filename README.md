# IMAP Sync

A modern web application for synchronizing IMAP mailboxes between different email accounts. Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript.

This project was created using [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) as a starting template.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Synchronize emails between IMAP mailboxes
- ðŸ”„ Configure sync options (batch size, retries, etc.)
- ðŸ“Š Monitor sync status and logs
- ðŸ”’ Secure connection testing
- ðŸ“± Responsive design

## Security

The application runs entirely on the client side, connecting directly to your IMAP servers. No data is stored on any server.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **IMAP Library**: ImapFlow
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ombicen/imapsync-nextjs.git
cd imapsync-nextjs
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```



5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email Provider (for password reset)
SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER="your-email@example.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

### IMAP Configuration

The application supports both TLS/SSL and STARTTLS connections. Configure your IMAP servers with:

- Host: IMAP server hostname or IP
- Port: IMAP port (993 for SSL/TLS, 143 for plain)
- Secure: Enable for SSL/TLS connections
- TLS: Enable for STARTTLS connections
- Username: Email address
- Password: Email password

## Usage

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Configure source and destination IMAP servers
3. Set sync options:
   - Batch size: Number of emails to process at once
   - Max retries: Number of retry attempts for failed operations
   - Retry delay: Time to wait between retries
4. Start the sync process
5. Monitor the sync status and logs in real-time

## Security

- All IMAP connections use secure TLS/SSL encryption
- Passwords are stored securely
- Connection timeouts and error handling are implemented
- Rate limiting is enforced
